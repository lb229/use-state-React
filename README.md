Extract the h2 tag showing the counter state variable into a new component called CounterDisplay and render it within the Counter component, passing it the count state variable as a prop.
Add a decrement button and a reset button to the Counter component. The decrement button should decrement the counter by the amount passed as a prop, and the reset button should reset the counter to the initial value passed as a prop.
